# Lab4-Collections

Java lab4 stands for to use collections from a group of lists, sets, and folders,
and to replace all arrays in applications with collections. As part of the exercise,
all groups are also in constant need of census replacements. They can also be found in
implementation exercises and algorithms that sort objects within collections.
